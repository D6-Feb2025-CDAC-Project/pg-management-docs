Now I’ll walk you through the key features available to the PG owner or admin in EasyPG. 
These are designed to bring structure and control to day-to-day PG operations

1. Here is the Admin dashboard — the control center for PG owners.
The admin dashboard gives a snapshot of the PG’s overall status — including total tenants, 
pending bookings, and unresolved complaints. It acts as the entry point for all important 
admin actions, offering clarity at a glance.

2. Manage Rooms/Properties - This section lets the admin add new rooms, update room details 
like occupancy and rent, or temporarily hide rooms that are under maintenance. It replaces manual 
record-keeping with a structured, easy-to-update system

3. Tenant Management - Here, the admin can see all active tenants, their profile details, 
rent status, and initiate actions — like sending reminders or processing exits. 
This helps automate rent tracking and reduces reliance on scattered messages or Excel sheets.

4. Manage Bookings - This panel displays incoming room bookings with relevant tenant info. 
The admin can confirm or decline requests based on availability — helping them manage occupancy 
more systematically.

We’ve also planned modules for managing complaints, updating PG rules, and sending rent 
notifications — these aren’t in the current UI demo but are part of our overall design scope

With these features, EasyPG aims to give PG owners a centralized, efficient way to manage their 
property and tenants — replacing manual chaos with clarity

That wraps up our presentation for EasyPG. We’re just getting started with development, 
and we’re excited to bring this idea to life in the coming weeks. Thank you.
